###Here from ness?
Then you're probably looking for one of these
  * [Testing Documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hav0hcgtedfuj29/jCPmztUFLL/installation-guide.pdf)
  * [Installation Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hav0hcgtedfuj29/roZxIRDpvT/Team%2013%20-%20Minitrainer%20Testing.pdf)

Or if you're looking to install the application on a device, you can find the **apk** file below

[Minitrainer.apk](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hav0hcgtedfuj29/xcM9Fg10X6/minitrainer.apk)

Just drop that file on your device and install it. Make sure to allow unverified sources first though!

####Don't have an Android device?
Don't have a device? Then download a copy of the repository and follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hav0hcgtedfuj29/roZxIRDpvT/Team%2013%20-%20Minitrainer%20Testing.pdf)

You'll need a copy of Eclipse with the Android Development Tools installed,

We recommend the [ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) developed by Google. It's cross platform compatible so you shouldn't have any problems setting it up!
